# CMF MES Usability Dashboard

With the idea of delving into the behavior of CMF's MES users, we have created this a dashboard with the data collected from the analytics and usability study.

## Running the project

1. We have 3 services: **Matomo**, **MySQL** and **NextJS** and we should be able to run them with:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

2. The target website should be running in parellel to this, which for this project we expect it to be MES, whether it is locally or in a custom development environment. You should provide the information of the domain of the targetted website the **configuration of the Matomo Dashboard setup** which should be available at `http://localhost:8081`.

3. After doing this you should see a complaint about the trusted host setup on the Matomo Dashboard. To fix this open a bash shell on the root of this project and run `bash hosts.sh`.

4. You may need to troubleshoot a few things in the setup:

- You will probably need to replace the Matomo API Token once you are setting up the containers for the first time. Go to the Matomo Dashboard: click the `gear icon`, then `personal`, `security`. Scroll down to **create auth token** and copy it into your `.env`.
- Remember to change the content of the `matomoTrackerConfig` variable in `src/app/app.module.ts` on the `CoreHTML` that is being used in CMF's MES. This should match the ports that we have chosen on this side.

## Environment Variables

### Matomo

Here are all the possible environment variables for the Matomo instance:

- `MATOMO_DATABASE_HOST`: The hostname of your MySQL service. In this case, it would be the name of your MySQL service in docker-compose.yml.
- `MATOMO_DATABASE_DBNAME`: The name of your Matomo database.
- `MATOMO_DATABASE_USERNAME`: The username for your Matomo database.
- `MATOMO_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: The password for your Matomo database.
- `MATOMO_DATABASE_TABLES_PREFIX`: The prefix for the Matomo database tables.
- `MATOMO_DATABASE_ADAPTER`: The database adapter to use (PDO\MYSQL, MYSQLI).
- `MATOMO_DATABASE_CHARSET`: The character set to use for the Matomo database.
- `MATOMO_TRUSTED_HOSTS`: The list of trusted hosts.
- `MATOMO_PROXY_CLIENT_HEADERS`: The list of client headers used by a proxy.
- `MATOMO_PROXY_HOST_HEADERS`: The list of host headers used by a proxy.
- `MATOMO_SALT`: Salt used to hash passwords, tokens, etc. Needs to be a long, random and secure string.
- `MATOMO_SESSION_SAVE_HANDLER`: How sessions should be saved. "dbtable" by default.
- `MATOMO_SESSION_SAVE_PATH`: If the session save handler is set to "files", this is the path where the files will be saved.
- `MATOMO_MAIL_TRANSPORT`: The transport to use for sending mails ("smtp" or "sendmail" or "mail").
- `MATOMO_MAIL_HOST`: If the mail transport is set to "smtp", this is the host of your SMTP server.
- `MATOMO_MAIL_PORT`: If the mail transport is set to "smtp", this is the port of your SMTP server.
- `MATOMO_MAIL_USERNAME`: If the mail transport is set to "smtp", this is the username of your SMTP server.
- `MATOMO_MAIL_PASSWORD`: If the mail transport is set to "smtp", this is the password of your SMTP server.
- `MATOMO_MAIL_ENCRYPTION`: If the mail transport is set to "smtp", this is the encryption to use (ssl, tls).
- `MATOMO_GENERAL_FORCE_SSL`: If set to 1, Matomo will force the usage of SSL (https) for all connections.
- `MATOMO_GENERAL_FORCE_SSL_FOR_BACKEND`: If set to 1, Matomo will force the usage of SSL (https) for all connections for backend users.

### MySQL

- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: This is the one which is mandatory and allows you to set the root password.
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: This variable will create the specified database on the MySQL server.
- `MYSQL_USER` && `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: These variables are used in conjunction to create a new user, and to set that user's password.
